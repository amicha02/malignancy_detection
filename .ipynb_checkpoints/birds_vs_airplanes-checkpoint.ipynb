    "# Distinguishing birds from airplanes\n",
    "Jane, our friend at the bird-watching club, has set up a fleet of cameras in the woods south of the airport. The cameras are supposed to save a shot when something enters the frame and upload it to the club’s real-time bird-watching blog. The problem is that a lot of planes coming and going from the airport end up triggering the camera,]\n",

    "Jane spends a lot of time deleting pictures of airplanes from the blog. What she needs is an automated system like that shown in figure 7.6. Instead of manually delet- ing, she needs a neural network—an AI if we’re into fancy marketing speak—to throw away the airplanes right away.\n",
    "No worries! We’ll take care of that, no problem—we just got the perfect dataset for it (what a coincidence, right?). We’ll pick out all the birds and airplanes from our CIFAR-10 dataset and build a neural network that can tell birds and airplanes apart."

    "## CIFAR-10 Dataset\n",
    "It consists of 60,000 tiny 32 × 32 color (RGB) images, labeled with an inte- ger corresponding to 1 of 10 classes: airplane (0), automobile (1), bird (2), cat (3), deer (4), dog (5), frog (6), horse (7), ship (8), and truck (9).1 Nowadays, CIFAR-10 is considered too simple for developing or validating new research. We will use the torchvision module to automatically download the dataset and load it as a collection of PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "## Building the dataset\n",
    "We somewhat arbitrarily pick 512 hidden features. A neural network needs at least one hidden layer (of activations, so two modules) with a nonlinearity in between in order to be able to learn arbitrary functions.\n",

    "The hyperbolic tangent activation function is also referred to simply as the Tanh (also “tanh” and “TanH“) function.\n",
    "It is very similar to the sigmoid activation function and even has the same S-shape.The function takes any real value as input and outputs values in the range -1 to 1. The larger the input (more positive), the closer the output value will be to 1.0, whereas the smaller the input (more negative), the closer the output will be to -1.0.\n",
